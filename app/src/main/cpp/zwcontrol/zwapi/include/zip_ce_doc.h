/*! @mainpage Z-Ware CE C API
 *
 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * This library exposes C language API for Z-Ware CE library. The Z-Ware C API abstracts the existing Z/IP API into controllable interfaces for easier development and certification of controller based applications which should retain little Z-Wave specific code.
 *
 *
 * @section install_sec Installation
 *
 * @subsection build Build:
 * Run these commands to build external library:
 *
 *      source install_openssl_lib.sh                 #only need to run once to install external library for all platforms
 *
 *      source build_openssl_lib.sh linux [debug | release]  #build either debug or release library version for Ubuntu Linux
 *
 *      source build_openssl_lib.sh beaglebone [debug | release]  #build either debug or release library version for Beaglebone Black
 *
 * Run this command to build Z-Ware CE library:
 *
 *      make TARGET_PLATFORM=LINUX_ZIP2 [DEBUG=1] [SINGLE_CLIENT=1] #build for Ubuntu Linux; optional flag DEBUG is for debug version;
 *                                                                 #SINGLE_CLIENT is for restricting a single Z/IP client connecting to a Z/IP gateway as
 *                                                                 #oppose to default that supports multiple Z/IP clients.
 *
 *      make TARGET_PLATFORM=BEAGLEBONE_ZIP2 [DEBUG=1] [SINGLE_CLIENT=1] #build for Beaglebone Black; optional flag DEBUG is for debug version;
 *                                                                       #SINGLE_CLIENT is for restricting a single Z/IP client connecting to a Z/IP gateway as
 *                                                                       #oppose to default that supports multiple Z/IP clients.
 *
 * Run this command to build sample applications:
 *
 *      cd <project directory>/demos
 *
 *      make TARGET_PLATFORM=LINUX_ZIP2 [DEBUG=1] #build either debug or release version of applications for Ubuntu Linux
 *
 *      make TARGET_PLATFORM=BEAGLEBONE_ZIP2 [DEBUG=1] #build either debug or release version of applications for Beaglebone Black
 *
 *	@subsection install Install:
 *      The libraries are located in \<project directory\>/src/libzip_ctl.a and \<project directory\>/lib/libzip_api.a
 *
 *      The external libraries are located in  \<project directory\>/../openssl/install/lib/libcrypto.a and  \<project directory\>/../openssl/install/lib/libssl.a
