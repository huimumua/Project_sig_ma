/** \ingroup processes
 * \defgroup Portal_handler Z/IP portal connection processes
 * The Z/IP Gateway provides a means of Remote Access through a secure
 * Transport Layer Security (TLS) v1.1 based Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)/IPv4
 * connection over port 44123 to a portal, with a Domain Name System (DNS) resolvable
 * Uniform Resource Locator (URL), outside the home network, synchronized by an internal
 * Network Time Protocol (NTP) client.
 *
 * It is the Z/IP Gateway that initiates this connection to the portal; attempting
 * connection every 5 seconds on failure.  On connection, the Z/IP Gateway sends a
 * keep-alive every 5 seconds.  On some platforms it may take a considerable amount
 * of time to establish the secure tunnel, as it uses a 2-way handshake with RSA-1024
 * certificates with Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) -1 digest.  If the connection breaks
 * down, the Z/IP Gateway supports session resumption within 24 hours in less than
 * 10 seconds.  After connection has been set up, Z/IP packets over this connection are
 * encrypted with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 128.
